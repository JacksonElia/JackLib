**CURRENTLY IN PROGRESS**

This repository contains all of the code I have developed for FRC robot programming. If you are considering using some of this code for your own robot, all I ask for is a ‚≠ê.

If your are still unsure of how to implement any of the code, please email me at [jackgeorgeelia@gmail.com](mailto:jackgeorgeelia@gmail.com)
